# Set to true to use mock GitHub client instead of real GitHub API (useful for development to avoid rate limits)

# Backend API mount path
# Accepts "/" for root or an absolute path like "/api". Leading/trailing whitespace is trimmed and
# redundant slashes at the end are removed when the value is parsed, and a missing leading slash is added automatically.
